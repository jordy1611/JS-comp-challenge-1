## Objective
Begin working and understanding HTML and CSS. Create a webpage based off of a provided static comp, using only HTML and CSS, in order to practice designing webpages while still reflecting the designer's layout and designs. Discover how a user could best experience the content/layout across various screen sizes.

## Set Up Instructions
